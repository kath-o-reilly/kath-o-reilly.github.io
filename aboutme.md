subtitle: Hello.

I’m Kath O’Reilly. I’m an Associate Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I’m an infectious disease epidemiologist, with an interest in most things in the natural world and further afield. The world is a fascinating place, and here I plan to write about things that fascinate me. Perhaps this interest will be a little…infectious?
